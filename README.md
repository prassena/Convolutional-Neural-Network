# Convolutional-Neural-Network
CNN on MNIST Dataset

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data.

A CNN uses a system much like a multilayer perceptron that has been designed for reduced processing requirements. The layers of a CNN consist of an input layer, an output layer and a hidden layer that includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers and normalization layers. 

As number of layers increases the model overfits and when number of layers are low it underfits .there are lot of hyper paramater in Neural Networks some are Number of neuors in each layer,type of activation function,type of optimizer,weight initilizer etc.

How CNN differs from MLP is that,in MLP we give a flattened image as a vector as input ,but in CNN we give image itself as input .we dont the concept of pooling and convolution in MlP but it is ter in CNN.
